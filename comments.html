                        <p>The file structure follows the required standard with the addition of an "assets" directoy
                            that stores anything used in the HTML. Ideally this would also include the stylesheet, but
                            for now it just contains images.</p>

                        <h2>Structure</h2>
                        <p>A common structure that takes advantage of HTML5 semantic elements has been used. The body is
                            split into three primary rows, with the nvigation menu as the top row, a main section in the
                            middle row, and a footer as the bottom row. </p>
                        <p>The main section has a single child, which is a div that serves as a wrapper for the rest of
                            the main content. This containment scheme allows for the floating subpage that can be most
                            clearly seen on larger screens. The subpage itself is further split into multiple rows, with
                            the top row serving as the page header in a banner style. There are then any number of
                            subsections which are divs with the class "panel", which are rows that segregate subcontent.
                        </p>



                        <h2>Selectors</h2>
                        <p>A wide variety of selectors were used, so a small but representative sample have been
                            summarised here in the following table.</p>

                        <h1>Aesthetics</h1>
                        <p>It's difficult to make exciting features without JavaScript, so I tried to work within the
                            liits of CSS to make something clean and modern. I sacrifice IE11 performance for aesthetic
                            by making liberal use of advanced CSS such as flex-box and grid.

                        </p>
                        <h2>Interactivity</h2>
                        <p>
                            The UI is supposed to appear interactive instead of being a static site. To acheive this, I
                            have used box-shadows and border-radius to give a dashboard appearance to the main content.
                            All clickable items will respond when the mouse hovers over them by showing a pointer for
                            the cursor. The navigation menu also will respond by highlighting the item underneath the
                            cursor and it will use a short animation to transition between states. The presentation of
                            elements are reponsive to window sizes, giving life to the page.
                        </p>
                        <h2>Colour</h2>
                        <p>
                            I am of the belief that "less is more". As such, I have used a very basic colour scheme. The
                            navigation menu is just a near-black background with white text. This is all it needs to be,
                            because this navigation menu does not do anything exciting and should not be the focus of
                            attention. For a similar reason, the footer is also quite basic and uses a midnight blue.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The footer colour nicely complements the warm sunset theme I was going for. This is een
                            primarily in the banner, which is front and center for each page and uses warm colours that
                            set a comfortable mood. The rest of the main content is also quite minimal. I have gone with
                            a basic off white background for the viewing content, which provides good contrast without
                            using a light theme without burning the eyes.
                        </p>
                        <p>Primary section headings are a dark pastel green and subheadings are the midnight blue.
                            Tables do not need to be flasy,because their primary purpose is to convey data. A simple
                            alternating grey and white theme is enough to provide pleasing aesthetics that help reading
                            the table without being distracting.
                        </p>
                        <h2>Spacing and font</h2>
                        <p>I have used a sans-serif font family, which are widely accepted to be the most aesthetic on
                            electronic devices. I have tried to use logical spacing that gives strongly defined
                            structure to elements and other content. This improves readability and interpretability.</p>

                            and guidelines about to meet these standards. This initiative was used to guide the
                            development of this website.
                        </p>


                        <p>The intention of ensuring web accessibility means that people with disabilities are able
                            to
                            interact
                            with a website without significant limitations. These include accomodations for a wide
                            range of
                            impairments, such as vision, auditory, physical, etc.</p>


                        <h2>Text alternatives</h2>


                        <p>All non-text content has alternative text and this is done in multiple ways. For example,
                            all
                            images
                            have both an "alt" description added in the html as well as descriptive captions.</p>


                        <p>The use of semantic elements available in HTML5 allow the meaning and purpose of elements
                            to be
                            clearly identified by the browser and screen readers. Rather than having a a &lt;div&gt;
                            element
                            with the class="main", the &lt;main&gt; element is used. Other semantic elements I
                            used
                            include
                            &lt;nav&gt;, &lt;main&gt;, &lt;section&gt;, &lt;header&gt;, and &lt;footer&gt;. Using
                            these in
                            the
                            appropriate logical order gives a webpage a well defined structure without the need for
                            CSS
                            classes.
                        </p>

                                <h2>Responsive sizing and adaptive positioning</h2>


                                <p>The use of advanced CSS such as media-queries, grid, and flex-box ensure that
                                    elements can berestructured to best suit the available space. Using relative units,
                                    such as %, em, rem, vw, vh for font sizes as well as the height and width of
                                    elements allows adaptive sizing that can appropriate accomodate screen sizes and
                                    zoom.
                                </p>


                                <p>
                                    The use of padding, margins, or flexbox positioning alow text to have nice spacing
                                    from
                                    each
                                    other
                                    and borders, these improve readability.
                                    Media queries will adjust some selectors sepneding on the window dimensions. This
                                    allows
                                    the
                                    website
                                    to adjust for smaller or bigger screen sizes without any reduction in accessibility.
                                    Flexbox has been used creatively to keep sections ordered appropriately depending on
                                    the
                                    screen
                                    dimensions</p>

                                <img id="hbox-img" src="assets/mobile-site.png"

                        </section>

                        <h2>Colour</h2>


                        <p>The colour scheme considered colour contrast such that all elements and text are clearly
                            visible. The color scheme also has been chosen without color clashes that may be unreadable
                            by people with color vision impairments.</p>


                        <h2>UI and navigation</h2>


                        <p> The website has been designed so that it can be fully functional using just a keyboard or
                            just a mouse. All navigation links are defined in semantic nav HTML elements and use actual
                            text rather than images. The navigation menu is consistent between pages, and there is a
                            second navigation option in the footer. Anything that is clickable is clearly highlighted,
                            so a user will not have unexpected suprises, moreover, by default, the pressing backspace on
                            the keyboard will not behave like clicking a back button on the browser.
                        </p>

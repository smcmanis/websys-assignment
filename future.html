                        <h1>Future Plans</h1>
                        <p>Through university and work experiences, I have found that I really enjoy programming and
                            being creative. I was originally open to a future in research, but I have since realised
                            that writing formal papers is nowhere near as exciting as building something new.</p>

                        <p>I am interested in software engineering and data science. My major is artificial intelligence
                            and data analytics, so my long-term career path was to become a machine learning engineer. I
                            find backend development fun, except constructing SQL queries is boring. Frontend is very
                            creaive, but managing the little intricacies of HTML and CSS is incredibly tedious. </p>

                        <p>My past experience has given me a solid understanding of what I would like to do in the
                            future, however I am looking for a software engineering internship at a big company for
                            summer
                            2020/21. I have yet to experience collaborative development at a company, because my current
                            role is smilar to a freelancer and my Data61 internship was an individual project under one
                            supervisor.</p>
